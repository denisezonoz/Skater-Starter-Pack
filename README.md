HowdyHack Skater Starter Pack Website

intro:
  As a team that has never skated before, we realized that skating can be intimidating for beginners who are just starting out. We wanted to make the process easier by creating a website that consolidates all the essential skating resources in one place.

  Our website covers several aspects of learning how to skate. First, it teaches easy beginner skills through clear, step-by-step instructions â€” for example, how to stand correctly on the board and proper foot placement. Next, we included an interactive quiz to help users find out what kind of skater they are and what type of board suits them best. Finally, we focused on one of the most important parts of skating: injury prevention. We know that fear of getting hurt often stops people from trying, so we teach users how to fall safely and skate in different weather conditions.

 
Usage Instructions: 

Navigating through sections:
  All sections can be accessed by scolling up and down but there are also several buttons to help navigate website as well. For the skate board game just click and hold the skate board to drag it left and right over the hill. Basically have some fun with a digital skate board! In the "welcome to starter pack" portion you can click the button "Start learning" to head to the next section to choose your category. From there you can choose one of three buttons: a skateboard, helmet, or bone. These each represent sections on the webpage which are "Beginner Skills", "Equipment", and "Injury Prevention" respectively. You can also reach these sections by clicking the words at the top of the webpage in the navigation bar. There are several videos throughout the website that you can play by clicking on them. (You can also pause, fast forward, and rewind video) For article links just click the highlited text to open the article in another page and switch tabs to navigate back to website. 


How to take Skate board quiz:
    In the "Equipment" section there will be a button called "Find your perfect skateboard". When you click this button you will be redirectedto another page. Take the quiz by answering all questions and clicking the "See My Skateboard" button. Scroll down to see your results from the quiz. To retake quiz just change your andswers and hit the "See My Skateboard" button again. When done with quiz, click the "Back to Homepage" button to return to the website.


Future Plans:
  We want to add more graphics or "stickers" to give our website more personality and make it more visually appealing. We also want to add a comment/review section for feedback on our website, a chat room so skaters can post or talk to eachother.
