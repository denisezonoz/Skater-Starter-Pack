  <h2>History of Skating</h2>
  <p>
    Skateboarding began in California during the 1940s and 1950s, when surfers wanted to mimic the feeling of riding waves on land.
    These early boards were simple wooden planks with roller-skate wheels—earning the nickname “sidewalk surfing.”
    By the 1960s, companies like Hobie and Makaha began producing commercial skateboards, leading to the first competitions.
    Though popularity declined in the mid-60s, innovations like polyurethane wheels in the 1970s revived the sport and enabled new tricks.
    From backyard pools to city streets, skateboarding evolved into a worldwide culture of creativity, freedom, and movement.

  <h2>Benefits of Skating</h2>
  <p>
    Skateboarding strengthens both body and mind. Physically, it builds balance, coordination, and endurance.
    Mentally, it teaches resilience—every fall is a lesson, and every trick a victory earned through persistence.
    It’s also a community: skaters support and challenge each other, creating friendships that span generations and cultures.
    Whether you ride for fun, fitness, or creativity, skating keeps you grounded and inspired.
