      <h2>History of Skating</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="colored-paragraph">
      <p>
        Skateboarding emerged in California during the late 1940s and early 1950s as surfers sought to emulate the feeling of riding waves on land when the ocean was flat. 
        Initially, these creations were rudimentary, often just wooden planks with roller skate wheels attached, leading to the name "sidewalk surfing". This innovative fusion 
        of surf culture and street recreation led to the development of the first commercial skateboards by companies like Hobie and Makaha in the 1960s. Skateboarding's popularity 
        surged, culminating in the first skateboarding competition in 1963 in Hermosa Beach, California. Despite this initial boom, concerns over safety and the limitations of early 
        equipment led to a decline in popularity by 1965.

        The sport experienced a significant revival in the 1970s, largely due to two key innovations: the introduction of polyurethane wheels and the emergence of innovative skating styles. 
        Frank Nasworthy's development of polyurethane wheels in 1972 drastically improved board control and paved the way for new tricks and maneuvers. Concurrently, the legendary Zephyr 
        team, or Z-Boys, from Santa Monica, California, revolutionized the sport with their aggressive, surf-inspired style in drained swimming pools, popularizing vertical skateboarding. 
        The invention of the "ollie" by Alan Gelfand in 1978 further expanded the possibilities of skateboarding, allowing riders to launch into the air without grabbing the board.

        The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw skateboarding solidify its place as a global sport and cultural phenomenon. The 1980s fostered the growth of street skating, with pioneers 
        like Rodney Mullen developing foundational tricks such as the kickflip and the impossible. Skateboarding's integration into popular culture was amplified through media exposure 
        like the X Games, which debuted in 1995, and popular video game series like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. This culminated in skateboarding's debut as an Olympic sport at the Tokyo 2020 
        Summer Olympics (held in 2021), a testament to its evolution from a niche pastime to a globally recognized athletic and artistic expression.

  <h2>Benefits of Skating</h2>
  <p>
    Skateboarding strengthens both body and mind. Physically, it builds balance, coordination, and endurance.
    Mentally, it teaches resilience—every fall is a lesson, and every trick a victory earned through persistence.
    It’s also a community: skaters support and challenge each other, creating friendships that span generations and cultures.
    Whether you ride for fun, fitness, or creativity, skating keeps you grounded and inspired.
