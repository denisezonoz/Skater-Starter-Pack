    <p>Start with your stance, balance, and pushing technique. Every pro began here!</p>



    
    <h1>How to Stand & Balance</h1>
    <!-- add pic-->
    <img src="standbalance.webp" alt="Balance Stance" width="500" height="400">
    <p></p>
    
    <p style="text-align: left;">When you first step on a skateboard: </p>
    <ol>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Place your front foot roughly over the front bolts of the deck.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Slightly bend your knees, keep shoulders relaxed and eyes looking ahead (not at your feet).</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Once you’re comfortable, shift your weight gently from heel to toe of your front foot—this helps you feel how the board moves.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Practice staying in your stance for 30 seconds on flat ground, then push off lightly and stop to feel stability.</li>
    </ol>

    
    <p>Pro Tip: A stable stance = less wobble. On your first day, wear helmet + wrist guards to build confidence.</p>
    <p> </p>

    <h1>How to Push & Roll</h1>
    <!--add pic-->
    <img src="pushpull.png" alt="Push/pull" width="300" height="500">

    <p>Breaking down your first push:</p>
    <ol>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Keep your front foot on the board; your back foot pushes off the ground.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Push smoothly—don’t jump off aggressively. One clean push, then place your back foot on the tail (or near the rear bolts) and roll.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Practice pushing 10-20 feet, then come to a stop: shift weight to front foot and drag your back foot or gently press the tail to brake.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Repeat this 5–10 times until you’re comfortable.</li>
    </ol>

    <!--add article-->
    <p>Tip: Choose a smooth, flat surface (e.g., empty parking lot) for your first practice.</p>
    <p> </p>




    


    
    <h1>How to Turn</h1>
   
    <p class="center-aligned-class" style="text-align: left;"> Two basic turning techniques for beginners:</p>
    <ul >
      
        <li style="text-align: left">Lean / Carve Turn</li>
        <ul>
          <li style="text-align: left";>While rolling, gently lean your shoulders toward the direction you want to turn.</li>
          <li style="text-align: left">Bend your knees, keep board level, let the trucks (axles) pivot naturally.</li>
          <li style="text-align: left">Good for wide turns and gaining comfort.</li>
        </ul>
      
      <p> </p>
      
      <li style="text-align: left">Kick-turn</li>
        <ul>
          <li style="text-align: left">Roll forward at very low speed.</li>
          <li style="text-align: left">Move your back foot onto the tail, apply light pressure so the nose lifts slightly, pivot 90° (or less) by turning your shoulders and head.</li>
          <li style="text-align: left">Set your front foot down and roll away.</li>
        </ul>
      
    </ul>

    <h1>How to Learn Fundamental Tricks</h1>
    <!-- add image-->
    <img src="tricks.webp" alt="Tricks" width="600" height="400">
    
    <p>Here’s how to begin with your first trick: the ollie. Then you can move on to other beginner tricks like shove-it, pop-shove, and manuals.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>How to Ollie (Step by Step):</p>
     <ol>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Start rolling slowly in your comfortable stance.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Back foot on tail, front foot near middle of deck.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">Pop the tail down (jump backwards) while sliding front foot up toward the nose of the board.</li>
      <li style="text-align: left;">As the board lifts, level it in the air and land both feet over the bolts, knees bent.</li>
       <li style="text-align: left;">Roll away smoothly.</li>
    </ol>

      <h2>History of Skating</h2>
      

      
      <p>
        Skateboarding emerged in California during the late 1940s and early 1950s as surfers sought to emulate the feeling of riding waves on land when the ocean was flat. 
        Initially, these creations were rudimentary, often just wooden planks with roller skate wheels attached, leading to the name "sidewalk surfing". This innovative fusion 
        of surf culture and street recreation led to the development of the first commercial skateboards by companies like Hobie and Makaha in the 1960s. Skateboarding's popularity 
        surged, culminating in the first skateboarding competition in 1963 in Hermosa Beach, California. Despite this initial boom, concerns over safety and the limitations of early 
        equipment led to a decline in popularity by 1965. 
      </p>
     

      
      <p>     
        The sport experienced a significant revival in the 1970s, largely due to two key innovations: the introduction of polyurethane wheels and the emergence of innovative skating styles. 
        Frank Nasworthy's development of polyurethane wheels in 1972 drastically improved board control and paved the way for new tricks and maneuvers. Concurrently, the legendary Zephyr 
        team, or Z-Boys, from Santa Monica, California, revolutionized the sport with their aggressive, surf-inspired style in drained swimming pools, popularizing vertical skateboarding. 
        The invention of the "ollie" by Alan Gelfand in 1978 further expanded the possibilities of skateboarding, allowing riders to launch into the air without grabbing the board. 
      </p>
    

       
      <p>     
        The late 20th and early 21st centuries saw skateboarding solidify its place as a global sport and cultural phenomenon. The 1980s fostered the growth of street skating, with pioneers 
        like Rodney Mullen developing foundational tricks such as the kickflip and the impossible. Skateboarding's integration into popular culture was amplified through media exposure 
        like the X Games, which debuted in 1995, and popular video game series like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. This culminated in skateboarding's debut as an Olympic sport at the Tokyo 2020 
        Summer Olympics (held in 2021), a testament to its evolution from a niche pastime to a globally recognized athletic and artistic expression.

<!-- BENEFITS SECTION -->
 <section id="benefits">
  <h2 ">Benefits of Skating</h2>
    
      <h1> </h1>

       
       <h4 class="colored-header">Strengthen the Body</h4>
       

       <p>     
         Skateboarding is an excellent full-body workout that strengthens muscles and improves cardiovascular health. While many assume it only works the legs, a skater’s entire body is 
         engaged to maintain balance and perform tricks. Pushing the board builds significant lower body strength, while the core muscles—including the abdominals, obliques, and lower 
         back—are constantly activated to stabilize the body, especially on uneven terrain. Furthermore, the quick, explosive movements required for tricks provide a fantastic cardio 
         workout, raising the heart rate and improving oxygen flow. Even casual, flat-ground cruising burns a significant number of calories and provides a low-impact alternative to 
         running.
       </p>
     
        <h4 class="colored-header">Strengthen the Mind</h4>
    
       <p>     
         Beyond physical exercise, skateboarding significantly enhances mental and emotional resilience. The process of learning a new trick is often marked by repeated failure and 
         falling, which teaches persistence and patience. Skateboarders learn to brush themselves off and try again, building mental toughness and a growth mindset. The focus required 
         to concentrate on a trick or navigate a spot can also be meditative, providing an escape from daily stresses and improving concentration. This cycle of challenging oneself, 
         failing, and ultimately succeeding is highly rewarding and boosts overall confidence. 
       </p>
       
        <h4 class="colored-header">Strengthen the Community</h4>
        
       <p>     
         Skateboarding is known for fostering a strong sense of community and social connection. Skateparks and local spots serve as hubs where people from diverse backgrounds meet, 
         bond over a shared passion, and form friendships. This sense of belonging is a key component of mental well-being, combating loneliness and social isolation. Skateboarding 
         is an inclusive activity, often welcoming people regardless of age, race, or gender, with communities built on mutual respect and a shared stoke for the sport. This supportive 
         environment allows skaters to learn from one another and celebrate each other's successes, strengthening social bonds that can last a lifetime.
